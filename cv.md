**RGB To Hex Conversion from Codewars:**<br> 
*Write a function that passing in RGB decimal values will result in a hexadecimal representation being returned. Valid decimal values for RGB are 0 - 255. Any values that fall out of that range must be rounded to the closest valid value.*
```javascript
function rgb(r, g, b) {
  const toHex = (value) => {
    if(value < 0) {
      return '00';
    }
    if(value > 255) {
      return 'FF';
    }
    return (value > 15 ? value.toString(16) : '0' + value.toString(16)).toUpperCase();
  }
  return toHex(r) + toHex(g) + toHex(b);
}
  
console.log(rgb(140, 23, 15))
